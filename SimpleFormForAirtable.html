<p>This web form can be anywhere. It sends the user input to an Airtable via kodou.io</p>
<form action="http://api.kodou.io/library/callhttp?jwt=eyJ0eXAXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" method="post">
    <input id="formAs" name="formAs" type="hidden" value="jsonstring">
    <input id="sessionid" name="sessionid"  type="hidden" value="eyJ0eXXXXXXXXXX">

    <ul>
        <div>
            <label for="name">Name:</label>
            <input type="text" id="name" name="ss_Name">
        </div>
        <div>
            <label for="age">Age:</label>
            <input type="number" id="age" name="sn_Age" min="1" max="120">
        </div>

        <div>
            <input type="radio" id="male" name="ms_Gender" value="Male"
               checked>
            <label for="male">Male</label>
        </div>
        <div>
            <input type="radio" id="female" name="ms_Gender" value="Female">
            <label for="female">Female</label>
        </div>

        <div class="button">
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </div>
    </ul>

</form>

<p>
    All form fields are text and need to be converted into an Airtable of the following column design
    Name [Single line text], Age [Number], Gender [Multiple selection]. The Airtable API uses Json for data
    representation so we need to properly format the Json for success. Therefore each form field needs to
    detail a type specification for the eventual Airtable call.
</p>
<p>
    The form field types must match the Airtable column data types. This is not handled by kodou since kodou does not
    know about Airtable. It is handled by a kodou user who created a function for writing to Airtable with correct types.
    kodou injested that function and now it is part of the library.
    The user created a function that needs the type information for Airtable matched to the form fields.
    The solution is simple, the form field follow a naming scheme that encodes Airtable type information.
    Notice the first 3 letters of all field names are two characters followed by an underscore. The first character
    specifies single or multiple data, the second character is the data type (s String, n Number, b Boolean).
    This shows how flexible kodou is for handling different needs.
</p>
<p>
    This form has a hidden field named 'formAs' with the value 'jsonstring', which library/callhttp interprets that
    the form fields are to be treated as a single Json payload in kodou and as the last argument of the function
    being called. This is a currying approach. The other option is formAs=parameters where field names match function
    parameters.
    sessionid is another hidden formfield. It references code (the function) in a kodou library (from open or proprietary sources).
    and was created from an API call. All the kodou routing information is cryptographically embedded in the sessionid.
    The first set of function parameters were bound (currying) when sessionid was created. Every kodou call using sessionid
    has them set, so you just need the final argument which is the json string of form fields.
</p>
<p>
    kodou.io is the API endpoint with a jwt token for authentication in the url. The library/callhttp
    path is a special version of library/call. It incorporates http semantics such as form url encoding.
</p>
<p>
    Where did the sessionid come from? The crypto encrypted function in kodou's library? These functions are
    requested using kodou's setup urls such as library/setup. This path accepts kodou function url and arguments bindings
    for function calls. The token returned is the sessionid for subsequent calls.
    The jwt token value is assigned to each user from kodou.
